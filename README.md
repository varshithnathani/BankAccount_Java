# BankAccount_Java
In this Java file I have Created the BankAccount class file separately and access it with Bank.java file using new keyword which provides the instance memory for my program and then i have taken some values to validate the program.

First you have to download the BankAccount.java file, then download the Bank.java file you can just compile and execcute the Bank.java. you won't get any error.

BankAccount.java automatically creates .class file when you execute the Bank.java file.
